# Full Stack Task Manager App

A full-stack Task Manager app built using **React Native** with **Expo** for the frontend and **Node.js** with **Express** for the backend. The app utilizes **Firebase** (Firestore Database) to store and manage tasks. The frontend communicates with the backend via **Axios** for smooth and efficient API interactions.

## Features

### Frontend (React Native with Expo):
- **Task List Screen**: Displays a list of tasks with options to mark tasks as completed or delete them.
- **Add Task Screen**: Allows users to create new tasks by providing a title and description.
- **Navigation**: Uses **React Navigation** to switch seamlessly between screens (Task List and Add Task).
- **UI Design**: Clean, modern, and user-friendly design ensuring an intuitive user experience.

### Backend (Node.js with Express & Firebase):
- **API Routes**:
  - `GET /api/tasks`: Retrieve all tasks from the database.
  - `POST /api/tasks`: Add a new task.
  - `PUT /api/tasks/:id`: Mark a specific task as completed.
  - `DELETE /api/tasks/:id`: Delete a specific task from the database.
- **Firebase**: Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore is used to persist tasks.
